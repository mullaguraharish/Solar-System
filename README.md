# Solar-System
## A Graphics Project Bulit Using OpenGL API

## Problem Motivation
- The simulation of the images can’t be captured by an actual camera. By using OpenGL, we view the 3d objects and the 3d space that helps to project and capture the frame from any angle in the solar system.

## Problem Statement
- To write a program in OpenGL that will accurately animate the Solar System which can’t be captured by an actual camera precisely.
 
## Problem Solution
- By using OpenGL, we view the 3d objects and the 3d space that helps to project and capture the frame from any angle in the solar system

## Abstract
- Computer graphics is the process of making the design, 2D, 3D, and animation of an object. 
- The movement of celestial bodies like the sun, stars, planets, and the others will be more easily understood if taught through visualization movement through computer animation. 
- This visualization shows the solar system’s planetary motion which moves around the sun and remains in each orbit. We use OpenGL to represent the solar system as a visual. 
- OpenGL supports this modeling capability as OpenGL has additional features to better produce something more realistic.

**For more details about the project please refer to [**"Solar System Report.pdf"**][1] and [**"Solar System PPT.pdf"**][2]**

## Get Started

The below steps show how to get started with the code running!.

- How to execute the File:  
```g++ SolarSystem.cpp -o SolarSystem lopengl32 lglew32 -lfreeglut -lglu32```

An executable file is created after the successful execution of the code.

- How to run the .exe File: 
Run ```./SolarSystem.exe```

Now, we can see the output and the Solar System animations clearly.
